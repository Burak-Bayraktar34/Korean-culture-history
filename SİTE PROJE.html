        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKorea (Korean: 한국, romanized: Hanguk in South Korea or 조선, Chosŏn in North Korea) is a peninsular region in East Asia. Since 1945, it has been divided at or near the 38th parallel, now known as the Korean Demilitarized Zone. In 1948, two states declared independence, both claiming sovereignty over all of Korea: South Korea (Republic of Korea) comprising its southern half and North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) comprising its northern half. </p>

        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp According to the mythic account recounted in the Samguk Yusa (1280s), the Gojoseon kingdom was founded in northern Korea and southern Manchuria in 2334 BC. The first written historical record on Gojoseon can be found from the text Guanzi. The Jin state was formed in southern Korea by the 3rd century BC. In the late 2nd century BC, Gojoseon eventually fell to the Han dynasty of China, which led to succeeding warring states, the Proto–Three Kingdoms period.</p>

        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.re-thinkingthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/A5212-Modern-and-traditional-Architecture-in-South-Korea.jpg?w=999" alt="Trulli" width="333" height="200" class="center-image">

        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp South Korea has global popularity that is increasing momentously in the fields of entertainment, technology, and innovation. Popular for K-pop and K-dramas, South Korea is also famous for its architecture and culture. A rich mix of culture and tradition is seen in the architecture of South Korea where old palaces and temples turned into tourism spots have gained attention. Modern architecture is also a growing trend and has resulted in iconic structures using innovative technology and creativity. . There are a total of nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites in South Korea showcasing the traditional style of architecture. Now, let’s look at the architecture in South Korea in detail: </p>
        <h1 style="font-size:150%;">1. Changdeokgung Palace, Seoul:</h1>
        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.re-thinkingthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/A5212-Modern-and-traditional-Architecture-in-South-Korea-Image-1.jpg?w=999" alt="Trulli" width="333" height="200" class="center-image">
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It is one of the 5 grand palaces of Korea exhibiting the lifestyle of Joseon Dynasty (1392–1897). It is spread across an area of 110 acres and has around 13 buildings remaining along with large landscaped gardens and pavilion spaces. It consists of buildings with large pitched sloping roofs acclimatized to the snow and rain. The flooring is mainly made of stone and wood with a heating system. The palaces usually had deviated access to create a sense of enclosure and importance to the king and his family. 
          The palace consists of various spaces for different activities like the administration, library, archery grounds, gathering halls, etc. the exquisite gardens seem to have a large number of indigenous species some of which are over 300 years old. The palace became a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1997.</p>
        
          <h1 style="font-size:150%;">2. Hwaeomsa Temple, Jirisan:</h1>
          <img src=" https://res.heraldm.com/content/image/2021/07/29/20210729000691_0.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="333" height="200" class="center-image">
          <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It is a large temple for Buddhists built at Jirisan. It was a sacred space for worship and knowledge. It consists of 2 main halls; the Jangnyukjeon Hall and the Gakhwangjeon Hall. During the Japanese war, the temple caught fire and was burned completely. However, it was restored in the 1630s to its former glory. Gakhwangjeon Hall is considered a great example of the mid-Joseon era architecture with its double story height, 7 bays width made up of wood placed on top of the stone. 

            Many cultural attributes are preserved and the structure is conserved to this day. Scroll paintings, gold motifs, pagodas are all displayed for the tourists. </p>
          
        
            <h1 style="font-size:150%;">3. Hahoe Folk Village :</h1>
            <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.re-thinkingthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/A5212-Modern-and-traditional-Architecture-in-South-Korea-Image-4.jpg?w=999" alt="Trulli" width="333" height="200" class="center-image">
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp However, South Korea was not as developed as it is today. Due to the political wars, the country went into a state of poverty in the 1950s. In an attempt to fix the problems, the newly formed government concentrated on manufacturing and trading as a means to improve the economic conditions in the country. So this process has resulted in leading industries and manufacturing units across the country.  </p>
